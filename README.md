# countdown_timer
This code implements a countdown timer in Python.

The user is prompted to enter a target date and time. The code then calculates the time difference between the current datetime and the target datetime. The countdown is displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds format. The countdown is updated every second using the time.sleep(1) function.

Once the countdown reaches zero, the message "Countdown finished!" is displayed.

Overall, this code allows users to set a target datetime and displays a countdown timer until that datetime is reached.
